# Hate speech projects

This is the result of two interdisciplinary projects of [Social Network Analysis course](https://elearning.unipd.it/scienzeumane/course/view.php?id=9257), held at the University of Padova by Tommaso Erseghe and Caterina Suitner.

The analysis are based on the database collected and coded by Amnesty International - Italy for its research ["Il Barometro dell'odio - elezioni europee 2019"](https://www.amnesty.it/cosa-facciamo/elezioni-europee/). Salvatore Romano has further coded the politicians' contents for his [master thesis](https://github.com/SalvatoreRomano1/thesis) "Haters gonna (make you) hate: il Negative Campaign come predittore dellâ€™hate speech online nelle elezioni europee del 2019 in Italia."

The full database is not available to the public. You can request to use it for research purposes at Amnesty International.
This project will rely on a [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zwXprmJgb6MEf1bFNjTDd_gHFF-fVIRE?usp=sharing) with the files that will not be public, only available to the members of the groups. 


# Week 1 - common start
In the first week (from 23/11/20202 to 04/11/2020), we will work all together as one big group.
Because we already have a ready-made database, we will "play with data" to understand all the features we can use in the next part of the project.
Go to the folder on this repository ```common start```, you will find more details on what to do.
